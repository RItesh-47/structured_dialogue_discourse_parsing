petoix , also when i minimize a window it disappers and i have to use alt tab to change !
Madpilot , app windows should show up in your bottom panel
shadowplay , right-click on either bar -- add . choose windowlist .
Madpilot , thanks , that was going to be my next suggestion ! EMOJI
shadowplay , applications -- sound video -- volume control
shadowplay , if there are red x 's at the bottom of each slider , that means the channel is muted
shadowplay , petoix click on it to enable it
shadowplay , ok , and the volume sliders are up right ?
shadowplay , open a terminal ( i think it 's applications -- accessories - terminal ; or console )
shadowplay , replacing 'the_file '' with teh filename you choose .

mneptok , sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic linux-restricted-modules-generic nvidia-glx sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
eternaljoy , is rthere a way ?
mneptok , yes , you reformat it like in any other os
thyazide , just ran that says everything is latest
eternaljoy , can i reformat ubuntu while its running itself ?
thyazide , 0 upgraded , 0 newly installed , 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded .
numan , i am going to install ubuntu 6.10 alternate cd image can you help me during installtion ?
crdlb , that 's because you still had the repo drivers installed when you ran the manual installer
numan , if i ask you for something ?
eternaljoy , so i format it from a livecd or something ?
crdlb , i can ( try to ) guide you through the process back to the repo drivers in ubuntu-effects

microlith , using -- pae these days is pointless
jiohdi , is there a way to tell the 64 to install itself over the 32 bit installation ?
hyperstream , what have you installed ? how did you install it ?
jiohdi , i installed 32 bit 9.10 on a 64 bit dual core machine via cd
hyperstream , ahh , then you need to use 32bit software
hyperstream , if you want to use 64bit stuff , you will need to reinstall the 64 bit version of ubuntu
defrysk , upto 4 gigs 64 bit is useless
jiohdi , technically it says i have 3.7g so its ok to keep 32 bit ?
jiohdi , there is no way to just upgrade from one to the other ?
jiohdi , what would have to be different for the 64 bit to be noticable ?
jiohdi , so even 4 g is meaningless these days ?

liam__ , how should i go about doing that
mwe , sudo rm FILEPATH then boot to runlevel 4
gepatino , or if you are using breezy , use the services manager
gepatino , you can disable many services from services manager , the one you should set off is gdm
gepatino , ok , so next time you reboot , you should n't get any x

meefs , can anyone tell me how to determine which ubuntu version i 'm running ?
ashmo , menu - system - about ubuntu ?
lemonsCC , media and mnt are the normal places
ashmo , but that seems so upcluttering and random .
ashmo , is n't FILEPATH for cds , etc ?
lemonsCC , you can throw a hd there too
lemonsCC , media gets an icon on the desktop and mnt doesnt is the difference
ashmo , ah , so mnt makes more sense if most users wo n't have access .
lemonsCC , well they will still have accessif they know where to look
lemonsCC , have it mount in your home folder

andrewski , if you do n't need it , you could disable hotplug .
andrewski , ( e.g . usb sticks , external drives )
hayden , so what if you want to use a usb stick after u reboot ?
andrewski , um , hotplug takes care of that . otherwise iirc you have to load the driver manually .

jiohdi , i installed 32 bit 9.10 on a 64 bit dual core machine via cd

hyperstream , if you want to use 64bit stuff , you will need to reinstall the 64 bit version of ubuntu
defrysk , upto 4 gigs 64 bit is useless
jiohdi , technically it says i have 3.7g so its ok to keep 32 bit ?

jrib , in a channel with so many users , it 's very helpful , yes
subcool , sudo chmod ugox FILEPATH doesnt do anything .
papashou , if so , i will just take it to private chat- then no one can benefit .
jrib , then i 'd suggest you clear your zsh-related .z files and start with something simple to troubleshoot

mneptok , sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install linux-image-generic linux-restricted-modules-generic nvidia-glx sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
eternaljoy , is rthere a way ?
mneptok , yes , you reformat it like in any other os
thyazide , just ran that says everything is latest
numan , i tried this cd alternate also but it is only text mode installation not on the net ?
eternaljoy , can i reformat ubuntu while its running itself ?
thyazide , 0 upgraded , 0 newly installed , 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded .
numan , i am going to install ubuntu 6.10 alternate cd image can you help me during installtion ?
crdlb , that 's because you still had the repo drivers installed when you ran the manual installer
numan , if i ask you for something ?
crdlb , i can ( try to ) guide you through the process back to the repo drivers in ubuntu-effects

Jeremy93283 , mgolisch - no i just formatted it mgolisch - how do i add partitions ?
ConstantineXVI , formatting it to fat32 puts a partition on it
mgolisch , usualy you dont have to do that
ConstantineXVI , find a windows machine or some other piece of hardware , see if they recognize it at all
ConstantineXVI , probably , if it detects any other usb drive
Jeremy93283 , i have a mac and it detects the card
mgolisch , but the exact same card worked before ?

Photoguy , i 'm just asking a simple question .
jrib , ubuntu-offtopic is the answer to your question EMOJI
gohmifune , i get a blinking underscore when i press cntrlaltf7
jrib , stop gdm and start it again and see if you get any output
Dillizar , will the other account share the same `` home ''
jrib , no , but she can read all of the files by default
jrib , throw in FILEPATH too . and try ctrl-alt-f8 and 9 and see if anything is there

Pelo , do we have a release date for jaunty or is it too soon to ask ?
Happy-Dude , apr -- - beat me to it
kitche , why not check the ubuntu1 channel and see ?
arkady , it does other stuff like rtp streaming , etc , but needs alsa to handle the local sound card
Pelo , i started by asking ubottu but it did n't have the info
kitche , usually the channel has it in the topic if there is a date
sprinkmeier , end april ( did i hear 23rd ? )
arkady , then explain this : default sink : alsa_output.pci_8086_284b_sound_card_0_alsa_playback_0
blahblah1lah , alright , let me look once more at that..
blahblah1lah , which menu should i check at ?
sprinkmeier , edit-prefs-security ? ( not running ff at the moment , going from memory )

Psi-Jack , but otherwise , yes , i have played a surround-sound dvd , and it played beautifully with surround .
czr , ok. sounds good , yell if you need me have fun
shadowplay , what sound card do you use ?
Psi-Jack , a soundblaster pci 512 for the primary , and the on-board via 82cxx for the secondary .
czr , pcm.foobar { type hw n card 0 n device 0 }
czr , then you could use foobar to mean hw:0,0
czr , .asound.rc is read by alsalib whenever a program wants to use alsa , so it will magically work

trism , what do you get if you enter the command : env grep im_module ;
plumpskunk , qt_im_module=ibus gtk_im_module=ibus
trism , ok that looks good , in FILEPATH support ; did you set the keyboard input method to ibus ?
trism , try doing that and then test items from the menus
trism , you might need to log FILEPATH out ; ( if it works at all )
plumpskunk , does n't make any difference , only that my dead keys and compose key is not working anymore
