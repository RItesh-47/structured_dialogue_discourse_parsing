Ecnassianer , there 's a file called k20firestarter in rc1.d already
sethk , then it should be starting . check ; that file should be a link to the script in FILEPATH
sethk , sounds like it needs to come up later in the boot sequence .
sethk , try adding the start command to the end of FILEPATH

Allan , p.s . it 's hard to answer 3 people at once
_jason , a command like 'sudo echo hi ' works though ?
rikai , are you runing an amd64 release ?
rikai , thats why you cant install flash and java , there 's no 64bit versions .
_jason , run the command 'groups grep admin ' and see if it says anything
Allan , it says a bunch of meaningless stuff
_jason , hrmm , sudo used to work ?

sethk , generally that 's a configurable parameter that can be changed in the window manager configuration .
sethk , it certainly has nothing to do with the nvidia driver

askand , how do i edit permission on my external drive so i can FILEPATH
savvas , usb right ? it should be FILEPATH if it has no errors
savvas , do you know its FILEPATH path ?
askand , should i do a chmod 777 you think there is a better solution ?
savvas , you should do a : sudo dosfsck FILEPATH
savvas , maybe sudo chown -r would be better to change the owner EMOJI
askand , `` there are differences between boot sector and its backup . ''
savvas , sudo umount FILEPATH sudo dosfsck -t FILEPATH

mikebot , also , will it be less laggy when i 'm not running it from the cd ?
FlannelKing , that 's because of the font and stuff . nothing to do with resolution .
mikebot , oh , i 'll try changing it , thanks
Nunquam_Fidelis , can you change it via system prefs screen resolution ?
Madpilot , the livecd runs entirely off your ram , so the installed version will be a lot faster
mikebot , all the fonts are size 10

mcphail , you can choose to use less inodes if you wish
shinu , and why is it using more by default ?
trappist , i use reiserfs , but you 're going to have fs overhead with any filesystem
trappist , i think the default is 5
shinu , yeah i noticed that after the mkfs output
trappist , though there will be less waste on a reiserfs partition

mikebot , all the fonts are size 10

bajah , could anyone please answer my question
soreau , you should have desktop icons by default in 10.04 make sure the gconf key show_desktop is enabled in FILEPATH
bajah , i dont see the apps folder under root
soreau , it 's a gconf key path use gconf-editor for a gui
escott , its a little confusing what you are asking about . there is no apps folder thats a mac thing
soreau , otoh , intel drivers are kinda hit-n-miss FILEPATH is a gconf key path
escott , bajah sorry missed that you were in gconf-editor
buzain , lost my connection . i checked and gnome-settings-daemon still works but i lost the color theme and icon thems
bajah , im in the nuatilus folder now

mustard5 , i 'm running xawtv so i guess its installed
ppd , are you sure ? what cpu load do you have when watching tv ?
mustard5 , never really paid much attentionlet me try

mustard5 , are rather something doesnt work EMOJI
ppd , mine would but the needed v4l module is missing
mustard5 , well there is v4l-conf ?
ppd , yes , but there should be a x.org module
mustard5 , i get this with lsmod v4l2_common 6016 1 bttv
ppd , i guess no , as overlay does n't work although that module is loaded by default

linux_galore , my cat drank it and now all its hair fell out
g1gaman , now it says gtk warning : can not open display
linux_galore , heh heh , much to learn about aussie humour
linux_galore , do you have the desktop running
g1gaman , no , i 've done ctrlaltf2 , then typed gnome-control-center in command line
linux_galore , ok you have to run it in a terminal on the desktop , its a graphical tool
g1gaman , i ca n't get terminal on desktop , 'cause i 've lost my panels
linux_galore , make sure you run sudo apt-get update first
linux_galore , then just logout of the gnome desktop and select the xfce4 desktop in the menu
g1gaman , i have setting that user logs in automatically without login screen
linux_galore , you can still log out and back in again or hit ctrl alt backspace

bajah , could anyone please answer my question
soreau , you should have desktop icons by default in 10.04 make sure the gconf key show_desktop is enabled in FILEPATH
bajah , i dont see the apps folder under root
soreau , it 's a gconf key path use gconf-editor for a gui
escott , its a little confusing what you are asking about . there is no apps folder thats a mac thing
soreau , otoh , intel drivers are kinda hit-n-miss FILEPATH is a gconf key path
escott , bajah sorry missed that you were in gconf-editor
buzain , lost my connection . i checked and gnome-settings-daemon still works but i lost the color theme and icon thems
bajah , im in the nuatilus folder now
escott , im not sure what would cause your gtk theme to disappear except for the settings daemon

_jason , firefox 1.5 is not in the breezy repositories
dlh , hi again EMOJI so there 's no `` normal '' way of installing it ?
_jason , there is guide for using the tarbal safely
Nickgarvey , that would be a pretty sweet wlan
DBO , yes , maybe they could use solar flares and transient cosmic radiation as a medium for communication transmission yes
chris__ , nickgarvey thank you so much !
DBO , no prob man , i like your questions , they dont make my brain hurt
_jason , they just run some cat5 to the nearest satellite EMOJI
DBO , you know there is a 100m limit on that

BLZbubba , what does it take to get ubuntu to stay in the default text mode until x starts ?
Dr_Willis , i normally use the options 'noquiet nosplash nofb ' to grub .
Dr_Willis , nosplash = disables plymouth i belive
BLZbubba , it still tries to do graphics with those options though does n't it ?
Dr_Willis , you mean starts up x ? the text option makes it not start the login manager
escott , nosplash doesnt do diddly to stop plymouth on any of my systems . il try nofb
Dr_Willis , i was thinking its been changed in 12.04 but i havent trried it lately
Dr_Willis , used tobe i always used 'nosplash nofb verbose text '
escott , im not on 12.04 yet
Dr_Willis , no idea then . used to work . perhaps its the combo of the options

oCean , this channel is not for general discussion and opinions . try ubuntu-offtopic
kisuke , 11.04 comes with unnity , the only gnome 3 packages avalible have more bugs than a bait shop afaik
morth , hehe , that 's what im using atm
kisuke , but gnoome2 or kde work fine .

mikebot , also , will it be less laggy when i 'm not running it from the cd ?
FlannelKing , that 's because of the font and stuff . nothing to do with resolution .
mikebot , oh , i 'll try changing it , thanks
Nunquam_Fidelis , can you change it via system prefs screen resolution ?
Madpilot , the livecd runs entirely off your ram , so the installed version will be a lot faster
mikebot , all the fonts are size 10
Nunquam_Fidelis , sometimes things seem `` bigger '' in linux , at least in my experience
mustard5 , i would have trouble reading them if they were smaller EMOJI
cafuego , usually a function of using 75dpi fonts in a 96dpi x or vice versa .

Younder , alien can handle rpm on a ubuntu machine . though i do n't recommend it
ikonia , no , that 's nothing to do with what 's being discussed here
llutz , alien converts rpm packages , not more
Younder , i never claimed it was anything more.. or so i thought
Lint , because if a certain package is 'broken ' , the entire apt is paralyzed
ikonia , no it 's not you do n't install ( or you install and remove broken packages )
llutz , better to repair the packae than to use this stupid hacks
jpds , quite irrelevant , as this is an ubuntu channel .

sebsebseb , not much point putting 8.10 on now as i said , since 9.04 is out this thursday
gwkalrod , try another iso , to make sure the problem is n't the image file
sebsebseb , well if the md5sum 's matched the iso should be fine
KING , i do n't think the new version will fix my problems
sebsebseb , you can virtaul machine 8.10 inside windows , to try it , or use wubi

Jack_Sparrow , i have no problems with nautilus
mcphail , there are a few problems with permissions . it does not obey any umask etc
mcphail , just about any filemanager you care to try . i do most things from the terminal
Jack_Sparrow , please name one or two for me to try
mcphail , why not use konqueror , for example . search through synaptic
joao , if i want to start some program on bootup where do i put it ?
mcphail , at bootup or when the gui starts ?
Jack_Sparrow , you feel konqueror ( kde app ) running under gnome is better than nautilus ?
