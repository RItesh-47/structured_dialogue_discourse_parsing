Tomm , If you have a settlement on them
Tomm , you can get better trades
Dave , I thought that was the number ones
Tomm , the 3:1 means you can trade 3 of anything to 1 of anything
Dave , what about the other ones
Tomm , The resource ones -I think- mean you can trade 2 of any of that item to 1 of anything else

Dave , I didn't want that wheat anyway
Tomm , Anyone want anything for wood?
Tomm , seeing as no one is rolling 8's despite it being really likely.
Dave , equally likely for all numbers?
Dave , Although I guess it depends on how the rolls are simulated
rennoc1 , dont have any, sorry

Tomm , it isn't
Tomm , if it follows the proper game.
Tomm , You are rolling 2 dice...
Tomm , so there are more ways of rolling say an 8, rather than a 2
Dave , Yeah,
Dave , I mean if it's actually rolling two dice
Dave , then there are more 8's tha- well, yeha
Tomm , So no wood anyone?

Tomm , and/or how many do you want to give?

ljaybrad123 , I'm very tempted
ljaybrad123 , because its incredibly sore

gotwood4sheep , and if you're self employed
gotwood4sheep , you've gotta protect your income
gotwood4sheep , the report and/or questions of liability are most important
gotwood4sheep , maybe a trip to the doctors as well in that case
gotwood4sheep , ?
ljaybrad123 , yeah I went to docs
gotwood4sheep , well at least that's on file.
gotwood4sheep , I'd send the workplace a message
gotwood4sheep , checking they've filed an accident report
gotwood4sheep , and saying you're considering your options
ljaybrad123 , bad bruising
ljaybrad123 , but pretty sure it's not broken

gotwood4sheep , and doing it when you feel bad blows
ljaybrad123 , thanks

inca , and congrats on defending the title
gotwood4sheep , ta :D
inca , heh i did have a read through it, wonder if that helped
gotwood4sheep , good blog, interesting
inca , was surprised at some of the relative values of resources
gotwood4sheep , this game has some hidden complexity
gotwood4sheep , indeed yes
inca , i always saw clay as vital but they rate it as the least vital
gotwood4sheep , so it is
gotwood4sheep , the longest road is easiest to compete
gotwood4sheep , and settlements lose value
gotwood4sheep , ore/wheat ftw
gotwood4sheep , I underrated sheep for a while
gotwood4sheep , but they are great for card wins
gotwood4sheep , I must rush and walk the dog,
gotwood4sheep , we should chat more soon!

gotwood4sheep , ludicrous
dmm , for some reason i often find 10s are much rarer than they should be
gotwood4sheep , as rare as 4s ;)
dmm , that's how it should be!
dmm , but 4s always seem to come up more often in my experience

keyser84 , yes,

intemporaliter , Sorry.
keyser84 , but I will prob. suffer a lack of wood
